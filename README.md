# Bank-Loan-Analysis

Bank loans play a vital role in supporting individuals and businesses by providing necessary financial assistance to achieve their goals. However, it is equally important for borrowers and lenders to thoroughly understand the associated terms, costs, and responsibilities to ensure sound financial decisions and risk management.

This project involves the development of a comprehensive Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard using Power BI, supported by SQL for data validation and quality checks. The dashboard is designed to present key performance indicators (KPIs) and essential loan metrics derived from the dataset, offering valuable insights into loan distribution, repayment status, default trends, customer demographics, and more.

The objective is to provide a clear and interactive overview tailored for business stakeholders or banking clients, enabling them to monitor loan performance, identify potential risks, and make data-driven decisions effectively.

The accuracy and authenticity of the dashboard have been validated by cross-verifying its metrics and values with the results obtained from SQL queries executed on the underlying dataset.



S – Situation
"In the banking and finance domain, loan disbursement and recovery are critical operations. However, many organizations struggle with gaining clear visibility into loan performance, borrower risk, and repayment behavior. My project aimed to address this problem by building a Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard that offers actionable insights for stakeholders."

T – Task
"My objective was to design and develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that could help stakeholders:
	• Monitor KPIs related to loan disbursement and repayments.
	• Understand patterns across borrower demographics and regions.
	• Identify high-risk loans and default trends.
Additionally, I ensured the data was reliable by performing validation and quality checks using SQL."

A – Action
"I followed a structured approach:
	1. Data Cleaning & Validation: I used SQL to clean raw loan data, handle nulls, and validate fields like interest rate, funded amount, and loan status.
	2. Power BI Modeling: I created measures and relationships between tables to support dynamic filtering and drill-down.
	3. Dashboard Development:
		○ Summary Dashboard: Highlighted total loan applications, funded amount, average interest rate, DTI, and split between good vs bad loans.
		○ Overview Dashboard: Provided monthly trends, loan term analysis, employee length impact, regional distribution, loan purposes, and home ownership segmentation.
		○ Details Dashboard: A holistic view of borrower profiles, repayment patterns, and overall loan portfolio metrics."

R – Result
"The dashboard provided business users with a user-friendly, interactive tool to:
	• Quickly assess loan health via KPIs.
	• Detect risk-prone borrower segments and geographies.
	• Improve decision-making in approving or rejecting loan applications.
It increased the transparency of the loan portfolio and helped stakeholders prioritize actions based on data-backed insights."
