# Bank-Loan-Analysis

Bank loans play a vital role in supporting individuals and businesses by providing necessary financial assistance to achieve their goals. However, it is equally important for borrowers and lenders to thoroughly understand the associated terms, costs, and responsibilities to ensure sound financial decisions and risk management.

This project involves the development of a comprehensive Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard using Power BI, supported by SQL for data validation and quality checks. The dashboard is designed to present key performance indicators (KPIs) and essential loan metrics derived from the dataset, offering valuable insights into loan distribution, repayment status, default trends, customer demographics, and more.

The objective is to provide a clear and interactive overview tailored for business stakeholders or banking clients, enabling them to monitor loan performance, identify potential risks, and make data-driven decisions effectively.

The accuracy and authenticity of the dashboard have been validated by cross-verifying its metrics and values with the results obtained from SQL queries executed on the underlying dataset.
